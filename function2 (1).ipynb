        "2.> Mutable vs Immutable Objects in Python | by megha mohan | MediumMutable data types can be modified after they're created, while immutable data types cannot be altered once they're created. Examples of mutable data types include lists, dictionaries, and sets, while examples of immutable data types include strings, tuples, and integers.\n",
        "Immutable Data Types:\n",
        "Definition: Immutable data types cannot be changed once they're created. Attempting to modify them will result in a new object being created instead.\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "Strings: You can't directly change the characters within a string after it's been created. If you try to modify a string, a new string object is created.\n",
        "Tuples: Similar to strings, you can't modify the elements within a tuple after it's been created.\n",
        "Integers, Floats, Booleans: These primitive data types are also immutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.>\n",
        "The main difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation, while lists are mutable and can be modified. Additionally, tuples are more memory-efficient compared to lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.>\n",
        "Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs. A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates. As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.>  A set in Python offers distinct advantages over a list in specific scenarios, primarily related to uniqueness, membership testing, and set operations.\n",
        "Ensuring Uniqueness:\n",
        "Sets, by definition, do not allow duplicate elements. If maintaining a collection of unique items is crucial, using a set automatically handles this constraint. Adding a duplicate element to a set has no effect, while a list would allow it.\n",
        "Efficient Membership Testing:\n",
        "Checking if an element exists within a set is significantly faster than doing the same in a list, especially for large collections. Sets utilize a hash table structure, enabling near-constant time complexity for membership tests (using the in operator). Lists, on the other hand, require linear time complexity as they might need to iterate through each element.\n",
        "Set Operations:\n",
        "Sets provide built-in support for common set operations like union, intersection, and difference. These operations are highly optimized and efficient, making sets ideal when dealing with relationships between collections of data.\n",
        "Order Irrelevance:\n",
        "If the order of elements is not important, a set can be more appropriate. Sets are unordered collections, which can offer performance benefits in certain cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.>  A string is a sequence of characters between single or double quotes. A list is a sequence of items, where each item could be anything (an integer, a float, a string, etc).\n",
        "\n",
        "7.>  Data integrity when using tuples in Python revolves around leveraging their immutability. Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be modified, added, or removed. This characteristic makes tuples ideal for storing data that should remain constant throughout the program's execution, ensuring that the data is not accidentally or intentionally altered.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.>  Hash tables in data science\n",
        "In Python, the Dictionary data types represent the implementation of hash tables. The Keys in the dictionary are hashableâ€“they are generated by a hash function which generates a unique result for each unique value supplied to the hash function.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.>  Yes, a list in Python can contain elements of different data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.>  Python strings are \"immutable\" which means they cannot be changed after they are created (Java strings also use this immutable style). Since strings can't be changed, we construct *new* strings as we go to represent computed values.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.>  Dictionaries offer significant advantages over lists when tasks involve storing and retrieving data using key-value pairs and require fast lookups. Dictionaries, unlike lists, use a hash table, enabling direct access to values based on keys in O(1) time, while lists require sequential searching, resulting in O(n) time complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.>  Performance Optimization: Using tuple type over lists is better when working with large datasets or performance-critical code where immutability and efficient memory usage are beneficial. Example: Returning multiple values from a Type function.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.>  Sets, by definition, do not allow duplicate values. If you attempt to add a duplicate, it will be ignored.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.>  The in keyword in Python is a powerful operator used for membership testing and iteration. It helps determine whether an element exists within a given sequence, such as a list, tuple, string, set or dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.>  No, you cannot directly modify elements within a tuple once it has been created. Tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed, added, or removed after initialization. This immutability is a core characteristic of tuples in Python and is designed to ensure data integrity and predictability.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.>  a nested dictionary is a dictionary where the values are themselves dictionaries. It's a way to create a multi-layered or hierarchical structure for storing data. A common use case is representing complex data structures, like employee records organized by department, where each employee's details are stored in a nested dictionary.\n",
        "example:\n",
        "employee_data is the outer dictionary, where keys are departments (\"IT\", \"Marketing\").\n",
        "Each department's value is a nested dictionary, which holds employee information.\n",
        "Each employee's nested dictionary stores their name, ID, and salary.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.> The time complexity of retrieving a value by its key in a dictionary is O(1). This is because dictionaries use a hash table internally which allows constant time lookup. Why O(1)? Hash tables use the hash of the key to find the memory location which enables direct access.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.>  Lists are preferred over dictionaries when the order of elements is crucial, and when you need to access elements by their index or perform operations like appending or extending. Dictionaries are more suitable when you need to store and retrieve data based on unique keys, especially for large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.>  Dictionaries are often considered unordered because their primary purpose is efficient key-based lookup, not preserving insertion order. This means that when you access or iterate through a dictionary's elements, the order may not match the order in which they were initially inserted, especially in older Python versions. While Python 3.7 and later versions do preserve insertion order as an implementation detail, the focus remains on the key-value mapping, not the sequence of elements. This lack of guaranteed order can affect data retrieval in scenarios where the order of elements is important, requiring alternative approaches like sorting or using ordered data structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "20..>  In terms of data retrieval, lists and dictionaries in Python differ significantly. Lists are ordered collections, accessed by numerical index, while dictionaries store key-value pairs, accessed by their unique keys. This means accessing elements in a list is slower than accessing elements in a dictionary, as lists require searching through the elements until the desired index is found, while dictionaries offer direct access based on the key."
